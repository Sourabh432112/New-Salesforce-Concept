If the record is sent for approval using approval process then it is locked and user can't make any change to that record until it approved,rejected or recall

scnerio  - suppose there is 2 user, one of them is able to read and edit record and another one is only able to read it
So firstly check object level security - If object level security (if both has same profile)
then go for record level security - if OWD is private, 
then go for role level heiracy but if both have same role or same on heirachy and 
then check sharing rule and if there is not sharing rule and 
then check manual sharing and record is not manual shared 
then apex based sharing and if not 
then check if user 1 is part of account teams and user 2 is not, if not 
then check territory management if user 1 is assigned to territory where account is part of that territory


If you need to use pricebook then firstly you need to activate it
If you try to create opportunitylineitem record by adding new product and if product is not visible there then you need to check if product is added to opportunity 


we can call autolunched flow from record trigger flow

If you need to implement before and after trigger using flow on Account or any other object then you need to create 2 flows to perform before executeion and after execution



when you perform integration with external system using REST API then 
for synchronus - heap limit (6MB) and CPU limit()
for asynchrounus - healp limit (12 MB)

if the limit exceed the transaction is not going to happen. So to resolve this we can use following feature
1. use Bulk API 
2. Use Mulesofoft as middleware to make chuck of data and then send data to salesforce using REST API

there is 4 types of flows 
1. Screen flow
2. Record trigger flow
3. Autolunched flow
4. scheduled flow

we can use autolunched flow inside record trigger flow

if you need to perform any bulk operation like send email or update record then scheduled flow has limitation of 250k records in 24 hours , more than that you need to go for async apex

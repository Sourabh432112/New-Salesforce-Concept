scnerio  - suppose there is 2 user, one of them is able to read and edit record and another one is only able to read it
So firstly check object level security - If object level security (if both has same profile)
then go for record level security - if OWD is private, 
then go for role level heiracy but if both have same role or same on heirachy and 
then check sharing rule and if there is not sharing rule and 
then check manual sharing and record is not manual shared 
then apex based sharing and if not 
then check if user 1 is part of account teams and user 2 is not, if not 
then check territory management if user 1 is assigned to territory where account is part of that territory


If you need to use pricebook then firstly you need to activate it
If you try to create opportunitylineitem record by adding new product and if product is not visible there then you need to check if product is added to opportunity 


we can call autolunched flow from record trigger flow

If you need to implement before and after trigger using flow on Account or any other object then you need to create 2 flows to perform before executeion and after execution

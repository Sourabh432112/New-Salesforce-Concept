scnerio  - suppose there is 2 user, one of them is able to read and edit record and another one is only able to read it
So firstly check object level security - If object level security (if both has same profile)
then go for record level security - if OWD is private, 
then go for role level heiracy but if both have same role or same on heirachy and 
then check sharing rule and if there is not sharing rule and 
then check manual sharing and record is not manual shared 
then apex based sharing and if not 
then check if user 1 is part of account teams and user 2 is not, if not 
then check territory management if user 1 is assigned to territory where account is part of that territory
